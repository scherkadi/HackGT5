# HackGT5
Carpool Made Easy! App made for HackGT5

## Inspiration
We have watched our parents coordinate carpooling for events through text messages and emails. Why not make it simple with an app?
## What it does
Takes driver input (availability and days driven previously) to accurately assign the responsibility to a single driver.
## How we built it
We first brainstormed the idea and solutions on a whiteboard and then transferred this into simple Java code. Then using Android Studio, we implemented this solution into an Android app.
## Challenges we ran into
We had little to no Android Studio knowledge coming into the hackathon so we used HackGT as a means to learn more about Android Development. It was challenging to learn about the nuances of using Android Studio for the first time.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully transforming our simple Java program into a working Android app!!
## What we learned
We learned how to use Android Studio and design principles that come with creating User Interface for a product.
## What's next for Carpooling Made Easy!
In the future, we would like to expand on the app and implement the ability to plan transportation for multiple events in a single app.
